//when you create an object with the literal {}, the js engine  will translate it to this.
//and the same goes for the other data types too.

let x = {}; //let x = new Object();

//when you create an string with the literal, the js engine  will translate it to this.

let a = "create a string"; //new String(); {string literals: '',"",``}

let b = true; // new Boolean(); true, false.

let c = 1; //new Number(); 1, 2, 3, ....
